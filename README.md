# AWS Web Server Deployment with Terraform

Are you looking to automate your infrastructure deployment on AWS? Do you want to leverage the power of Terraform to easily provision and manage your resources? In this project, we will explore the process of deploying a web server on AWS using Terraform. Whether you’re a developer, sysadmin, or a cloud enthusiast, understanding how to automate infrastructure deployment is an invaluable skill. By the end of this project guide, you would be able to deploy your own web server on AWS with ease.

## Overview

Infrastructure automation has become a crucial aspect of modern software development. With the rise of cloud computing and the need for scalability and reliability, tools like Terraform have gained immense popularity. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is one of the leading cloud providers, offering a vast array of services for hosting and managing web applications. By combining Terraform’s infrastructure-as-code approach with AWS’s robust service offerings, we can achieve efficient and repeatable deployments.

## Project Highlights

This project covers all you need to know about deploying a web server on AWS using Terraform. I’ll walk you through:

1. **Setting Up Your Environment:** Configure your local development environment and ensure you have the necessary tools installed.

2. **Designing the Infrastructure:** Plan and design the architecture of your AWS infrastructure, considering factors like security, scalability, and performance.

3. **Writing the Terraform Code:** Dive into writing Terraform code to define and provision your infrastructure as code.
